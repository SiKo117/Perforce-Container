# Perforce-Container
Its a bash script for Ubuntu 18.04 to host Perforce on Docker.
I don't know how to code, i just used some AI language models to write this script so i was thinking of sharing this script to help others.
This script create the p4d.template file because for some reason while installing the perforce in the container it doesn't create while installation.

Installation Guide:
Just download the bash file (PerforceDeployScript.sh) and run it as sudo.

While the script running it ask for input
go with the default input of everything except P4ROOT directory.
***IMPORTANT NOTE: Make sure to put the perforce root directory as /perforce ****

In the end The script will login you into the perforce container.
